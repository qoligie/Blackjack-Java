# Blackjack – Java Game

## 🎮 Overview
This is a simple Blackjack game written in Java. It simulates the classic casino card game where the player competes against a dealer to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

I built this project as part of my coursework to practice object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, game state management, and user interaction through the console. It's designed to demonstrate clear class structures and fundamental Java programming skills.

## 🛠️ Features
- Standard Blackjack rules (hit/stand, bust, dealer AI)
- Dealer automatically follows house rules (hits until 17 or higher)
- Modular design with separate classes for Card, Deck, Player, and Game logic
- Simple text-based interface for user input and game progression

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure you have Java installed (Java 8 or higher recommended).
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the `src` folder in your terminal.
4. Compile all `.java` files:
5. Run the game:


## 📂 Folder Structure
- **src/** – Contains all Java source files
- `BlackjackModel.java` – Main game flow and user interaction
- `Deck.java` – Deck creation and shuffling
- `Card.java` – Card values and suits
- `Player.java` – Player hand management and actions

## 💡 What I Learned
- Applying OOP concepts to organize code into logical, maintainable classes
- Handling user input and validating choices in a text interface
- Implementing game state transitions and win/loss conditions
- Managing randomness (shuffling) and ensuring fair gameplay
- Writing clear, commented, and modular Java code
